# GC correction file creation

The script *createGCcontentFile.R* can help you create the input for ASCAT’s GC correction for any platform (both array and sequencing data). Please note that this can be quite CPU/memory intensive so should be run on a HPC. R dependencies: *doParallel*, *foreach* and *Biostrings*.

`Rscript createGCcontentFile.R SNPpos CORES REF`

 - `SNPpos` should contain the list of all probes with their genomic location (tab-separated).

| | Chr | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rs3094315 | 1 | 752566 |
| rs2073813 | 1 | 753541 |
| rs2905040 | 1 | 770216 |
| rs12124819 | 1 | 776546 |
| rs2980314 | 1 | 781258 |

 - `CORES` defines how many cores to use for the computation.
 - `REF` should be the path to your local reference genome. Make sure that chromosome names in `SNPpos` fit with `REF` (e.g. *chr1* is different from *1*). Please note that sequence must be A/C/G/T/N-based (some references contain lowercase letters for specific regions such as repetitive sequences).

The created output file (*GCcontent_SNPloci.txt*) should start like this, with one row per provided probe:

| | Chr | Position | 25bp | 50bp | 100bp | 200bp | 500bp | 1kb | 2kb | 5kb | 10kb | 20kb | 50kb | 100kb | 200kb | 500kb | 1Mb |

# Replication timing correction file creation
The R script *createReplicTimingfile.R* can help you create the optional replication timing input for ASCAT’s wave correction for any platform (both array and sequencing data). R dependency: *rtracklayer*.

`Rscript createReplicTimingFile.R SNPpos`

 - `SNPpos` is the same file provided to generate the GC correction file above. Please note that chromosomes names for replication timing data are *1*, *2*, etc. (not *chr1*, *chr2*, etc.).

The created output file (*ReplicationTiming_SNPloci.txt*) should start like this, with one row per provided probe:

Please note that replication timing information comes from [ENCODE](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeUwRepliSeq/) and is based on hg19. Therefore, script will only works on hg19/GRCh37 SNPs due to the lack of publicly available replication data on other genomes like hg38. However, one may lift-over hg38/GRCh38 loci to hg19/GRCh37 coordinates, extract replication timing information and reset coordinates back to hg38/GRCh38.
